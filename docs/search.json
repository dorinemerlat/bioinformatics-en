After extraction and fragmentation of the sample DNA, part of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced (Illumina Single End) in order to identify the bacteria present. Due to time constraints, only part of the data will be analysed.\n\n1.1 Raw data: FASTQ file\n\nImport the FASTQ file from the zenodo server:\n\nCopy the address of the link: https://zenodo.org/record/3977236/files/female_oral2.fastq-4143.gz\nIn Galaxy, use the Upload Data button (top left) then Paste/Fetch data, copy the link and launch (start).\n\nLook at the file (eye icon).\n\nWhat are the characteristics of the FASTQ format? Given that the scores are encoded using the SANGER/Illumina 1.8+ system, what is the score value for most of the bases at the start of the 1st read? Is this satisfactory?\n\n\n1.2 Quality control using FASTQ\nOpen the FASTQ Quality Control toolbox (left panel) and choose FastQC.\nFastQC\nExplore the quality of reads with FastQC (default settings). See the FastQC website for help and examples of analysis.\nPer Base Sequence Quality: How long are the reads? How does the quality evolve along the reads? Per sequence quality scores: What can be deduced from this graph? Per base sequence content: In the case of genome sequencing (without specific amplification), what should this graph look like? Is the result obtained normal in our case? Adapter content: Which adapter is detected?\n\n\n1.3 Read processing using Trimmomatic\n1.Use Trimmomatic (FASTQ Quality control section) to improve the quality of reads:\nPerform initial IllUMINACLIP step? Yes, select Nextera Sliding window trimming (proposed by default) Drop reads below a specific length (MINLEN): 20 2. Perform FastQC analysis again on the processed reads and compare the results to the raw data. Is the result acceptable?\n\nWhat would be the next step to identify the microbial species present in the snake’s oral cavity from these reads?"
