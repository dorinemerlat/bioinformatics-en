After extraction and fragmentation of the sample DNA, part of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced (Illumina Single End) in order to identify the bacteria present. Due to time constraints, only part of the data will be analysed.\n\n1.1 Raw data: FASTQ file\n\nImport the FASTQ file from the zenodo server:\n\nCopy the address of the link: https://zenodo.org/record/3977236/files/female_oral2.fastq-4143.gz\nIn Galaxy, use the Upload Data button (top left) then Paste/Fetch data, copy the link and launch (start).\n\nLook at the file (eye icon).\n\nWhat are the characteristics of the FASTQ format? Given that the scores are encoded using the SANGER/Illumina 1.8+ system, what is the score value for most of the bases at the start of the 1st read? Is this satisfactory?\n\n\n1.2 Quality control using FASTQ\nOpen the FASTQ Quality Control toolbox (left panel) and choose FastQC.\nFastQC\nExplore the quality of reads with FastQC (default settings). See the FastQC website for help and examples of analysis.\nPer Base Sequence Quality: How long are the reads? How does the quality evolve along the reads? Per sequence quality scores: What can be deduced from this graph? Per base sequence content: In the case of genome sequencing (without specific amplification), what should this graph look like? Is the result obtained normal in our case? Adapter content: Which adapter is detected?\n\n\n1.3 Read processing using Trimmomatic\n1.Use Trimmomatic (FASTQ Quality control section) to improve the quality of reads:\nPerform initial IllUMINACLIP step? Yes, select Nextera Sliding window trimming (proposed by default) Drop reads below a specific length (MINLEN): 20 2. Perform FastQC analysis again on the processed reads and compare the results to the raw data. Is the result acceptable?\n\nWhat would be the next step to identify the microbial species present in the snake’s oral cavity from these reads?"

Her family was one of the original trios in Hapmap project and she was part of the 1000 Genomes project.\nCreate an alias of the file with reads in your directory for easy access. For that, use the command ln, which create links between files. Links are pointers to files, allowing multiple references (aliases) to the same file. This way, you don’t need to duplicate large files, saving storage space and making file management easier.\nln -s &lt;path_to_original_file&gt; &lt;path_to_link_file&gt; \nThe option -sstands for “symbolic link.” A symbolic link is like a shortcut that points to the original file, enabling easy access. Unlike hard links, symbolic links can span different file systems, and if the original file is moved, the symbolic link can still point to it if it is relocated in the same system.\nCreate an alias for the reads (original path:/data/human/reads/chrom22.fastq) inside your directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nln -s /data/human/reads/chrom22.fastq .\nThe dot (.) refers to the current working directory. When you execute the command, this tells the system to create the symbolic link (alias) for chrom22.fastq in the current directory where you are running the command.\n\n\n\nCreate a directory for the reference of chromosome 22 (original path: /data/human/reference/human_genome.fasta) and create an alias for the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nmkdir reference\nln -s /data/human/reference/human_genome.fasta reference\n\n\n\nDisplay data with the command more.\nThe more command is used to display the contents of a file one screen at a time.

How many lines are used to represent each read?\nQ2. How many sequences are present in human_genome.fasta? What do they correspond to? Use the command grep to display only the identifier lines.\ngrep\nGrep, short for “global regular expression print”, is a command used for searching and matching text patterns in files contained in the regular expressions.\nDisplay the lines with a pattern:\ngrep \"&lt;pattern&gt;\" &lt;file_path&gt;\nThis command searches through the specified file and outputs the lines that contain the given pattern.\nCount the lines with a pattern:\ngrep -c \"&lt;pattern&gt;\" &lt;file_path&gt;\nThe -c option tells grep to count the number of lines that match the specified pattern rather than displaying them. This is useful for quickly determining how many occurrences of the pattern exist in the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n# Display the identifier lines\ngrep \"&gt;\" reference/human_genome.fasta \n\n# Count the identifier lines\ngrep -c \"&gt;\" reference/human_genome.fasta \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the fastqc tool to assess the quality of the reads. Before running fastqc, create a directory to store the output reports (with mkdircommand).\nFastQC\nFastQC is a quality control tool for high-throughput sequence data that provides an overview of various quality metrics, helping to identify potential issues with sequencing data.\nfastqc -o &lt;output_directory&gt; &lt;fastq_file&gt;\nThe option -o &lt;output_directory&gt; specifies the directory where the FastQC output files will be saved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nmkdir FastQCReport\nfastqc -o FastQCReport chrom22.fastq\nfastcq analyzes the file chrom22.fastq and saves the results in the FastQCReport directory.\n\n\n\nMove the HTML output files to your local computer to view the results in a browser. Use the scp command for this (in a local terminal).\nscp The scp command stands for “secure copy protocol.” It is used to securely transfer files between a local computer and a remote server or between two remote servers over an encrypted SSH connection. This ensures that the data is protected during transfer.\nTo copy file from a server to your computer, open a new terminal and use scp like this:\nscp &lt;username&gt;@&lt;server_adress&gt;:&lt;source_file_path&gt; &lt;target_file_path&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the path of a file\n\n\n\nIf you not sure of the path .html file, use the command realpath to known it. realpath &lt;file&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nscp &lt;username&gt;@tp.lbgi.fr:~/TdExome/FastQCReport/chrom22_fastqc.html .\nNote: Replace &lt;login&gt; with your username.

This will help you locate the file in your file explorer.\nQ3. How many sequences are available?\nQ4. What is the sequence length?\nQ5. Do you find poor quality sequences?\nQ6. What do you think of the overall data quality?\nQ7. Which part of the reads exhibit a lower quality?\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can align sequencing reads to a reference genome, we must prepare the reference file using two key tools: bwa index and samtools faidx.\nbwa index: The bwa index command is used to create an index of the reference genome (in this case, human_genome.fasta). This index allows the BWA algorithm to efficiently search and align sequencing reads to the reference. Without the index, BWA would not be able to quickly identify where in the genome each read belongs, making the alignment process slow or impossible. The index is essential for speeding up the read mapping process.\nbwa index &lt;reference_file&gt;\nsamtools faidx: Similarly, samtools faidx generates an index for the reference FASTA file. This index allows samtools and other bioinformatics tools to quickly retrieve specific sequences or regions from the reference genome. This is useful when working with large genomes where extracting specific chromosomes or regions manually would be inefficient. The .fai file generated by this command is used by downstream tools for fast reference lookups.\nsamtools faidx &lt;reference_file&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\ncd reference\nbwa index human_genome.fasta\nsamtools faidx human_genome.fasta\ncd ..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThese commands may take some time to complete (one hour). To save time, you can use the ln command to create links to already generated files.\nln -s /data/human/reference/human_genome.fasta.* reference/\n\n\nYou get a lots of new files, forming a small database that you will use to align reads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnow where you are\n\n\n\nTo find out your current location within the directory structure, use the command pwd (stands for “print working directory”). It outputs the full path of the directory you are currently in, helping you confirm your current location in the file system.\npwd\n\n\nbwa\nCreate a mapping directory (at the same level as Reference and FastQCReport directories), move there and run BWA with the maximum exact matches (MEM) algorithm. This algorithm is faster and more accurate than previous BWA algorithms for aligning high-throughput sequencing data.\nThe command bwa mem uses BWA use the MEM algorithm:\nbwa mem -o &lt;path_of_output&gt; &lt;path_of_reference&gt; &lt;path_of_reads&gt;\nParameters:\n\n-o: This option specifies the output file. In this case, the aligned reads will be saved in the mapping directory as chrom22.sam.\n&lt;path_of_reference&gt;: This is the reference genome file against which the reads will be aligned.\n&lt;path_of_reads&gt;: This is the input file containing the sequencing reads that you want to align to the reference genome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nmkdir mapping\nbwa mem -o mapping/chrom22.sam reference/human_genome.fasta chrom22.fastq\n\nbwa mem: use bwa with maximum exact matches (MEM) algorithm.\n-o: option to specify the output file.\n\n\n\n\nQ8. View the file built by BWA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nmore mapping/chrom22.sam\n\n\n\nQ9. What is the format of this file? What information can be found in it?\nTo manipulate the mapping file, we’ll use SAMtools.\nsamtools view This command is specifically used to convert between these formats and to filter, extract, or manipulate alignments.\nTo transform SAM file into BAM use the command like this:\nsamtools view -S -b -o &lt;name_of_BAM_output&gt; &lt;name_of_SAM_input&gt;\nWith:\n\n-S: indicate that the input file is in SAM format.\n-b: tell samtools to output the result in BAM format.\n-o: specify the name of the output file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\ncd mapping \nsamtools view -S -b -o chrom22.bam chrom22.sam \n\n\n\nQ10. What does the BAM file represent in relation to the SAM file?\nls\nThe ls command is used to list the contents of a directory in Linux. It provides a way to see files and subdirectories within the specified directory.\nls [-l] &lt;directory&gt;\nOptions:\n\n-l: This option provides a detailed listing. In this format, additional information about each file or directory is displayed, including:\n\nFile permissions\nNumber of links\nOwner name\nOwner group\nFile size (in bytes)\nLast modified date and time\nFile or directory name\n\n\nQ11. Compare the size of the SAM and BAM files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nls -l \n\n\n\nThe file now needs to be sorted and indexed with samtools sort and samtools index.\nsamtools sort\nThe samtools sort command is used to sort a BAM file. Sorting is essential for many downstream analyses, such as variant calling, as it organizes the reads in a way that allows for efficient processing. The command takes the following parameters:\nsamtools sort &lt;name_of_BAM_file&gt; -o &lt;name_of_sorted_BAM_file&gt;\nsamtools index\nThe samtools index command is used to create an index file for a sorted BAM file. Indexing allows for fast random access to data in the BAM file, making it easier and quicker to retrieve specific regions of interest during analysis. The command takes the following parameter:\nsamtools index &lt;name_of_sorted_BAM_file&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtools sort chrom22.bam -o chrom22.sorted.bam\nsamtools index chrom22.sorted.bam\n\n\n\nQ12. How is the file sorted now? To view its contents, use the command samtools view.\nsamtools view &lt;file_name&gt; | more\nThe pipe symbol (|) is used to connect the output of one command directly into the input of another. This allows for the chaining of commands, enabling you to perform complex tasks efficiently without the need to create intermediate files.\ncommand1 | command2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe Shortcut\n\n\n\n\nWindows and Linux: Alt Gr + 6\nMac keyboard: Option + Maj + L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtools view chrom22.sorted.bam | more\n\n\n\nTo view few statistics about the mapping, use idxStats:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtools idxstats chrom22.sorted.bam\n\n\n\nQ13. How do you explain these results?\nSelect the part of the alignment corresponding to chromosome 3. To filter the file, use again the command samtools view but add the region.\nsamtools view -b -o &lt;name_of_BAM_output&gt; &lt;name_of_BAM_input&gt; &lt;region&gt;\n\n-b: This option indicates that the output should be in BAM format.\n-o &lt;name_of_BAM_output&gt;: This specifies the name of the output BAM file.\n&lt;name_of_BAM_input&gt;: This is the name of the input BAM file you want to filter.\n&lt;region&gt;: Specify the region you want to extract, such as chromosome3 or chromosome3:1-1000000 to limit the output to a specific range on chromosome 3.\n\nIn your case, the region is the name of the sequence of chromosome 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtools view -b -o chrom22.sorted.filter.bam chrom22.sorted.bam chromosome22\n\n\n\nThen index this file with samtools index as previously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtools index chrom22.sorted.filter.bam\n\n\n\nDownload the two 2 bam files of the alignment of chromosome 22 (the .bam and the .bam.bai).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nscp &lt;login&gt;@tp.lbgi.fr:~/TdExome/mapping/chrom22.sorted.filter.bam* .\nNote: Replace &lt;login&gt; with your username.

Configure the display to highlight mismatches.\nQ14. Are reads exclusively mapped on exonic regions? Why?\nQ15. Do you think that all observed mismatches correspond to variants?\nQ16. What criteria have to be fulfilled to infer variants?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pileup is a column wise representation of the aligned read - at the base level - to the reference. The pileup file summarizes all data from the reads at each genomic region that is covered by at least one read.\nTo generate a pileup file using SAMtools, use samtools mpileup command.\nsamtools mpileup\n\n-f reference.fasta: Specifies the reference genome file.\naligned_reads.bam: Your input BAM file with aligned reads.\noutput.pileup: The name of the output pileup file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtools mpileup -f reference.fasta -C 50 aligned_reads.bam &gt; output.pileup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pileup described all aligned positions.

The command takes the following parameters:\nsamtools sort &lt;name_of_BAM_file&gt; -o &lt;name_of_sorted_BAM_file&gt;\nsamtools index\nThe samtools index command is used to create an index file for a sorted BAM file. Indexing allows for fast random access to data in the BAM file, making it easier and quicker to retrieve specific regions of interest during analysis. The command takes the following parameter:\nsamtools index &lt;name_of_sorted_BAM_file&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtools sort chrom22.bam -o chrom22.sorted.bam\nsamtools index chrom22.sorted.bam\n\n\n\nQ12. How is the file sorted now? To view its contents, use the command samtools view.\nsamtools view &lt;file_name&gt; | more\nThe pipe symbol (|) is used to connect the output of one command directly into the input of another. This allows for the chaining of commands, enabling you to perform complex tasks efficiently without the need to create intermediate files.\ncommand1 | command2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe Shortcut\n\n\n\n\nWindows and Linux: Alt Gr + 6\nMac keyboard: Option + Maj + L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtools view chrom22.sorted.bam | more\n\n\n\nTo view few statistics about the mapping, use idxStats:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtools idxstats chrom22.sorted.bam\n\n\n\nQ13. How do you explain these results?\nSelect the part of the alignment corresponding to chromosome 3. To filter the file, use again the command samtools view but add the region.\nsamtools view -b -o &lt;name_of_BAM_output&gt; &lt;name_of_BAM_input&gt; &lt;region&gt;\n\n-b: This option indicates that the output should be in BAM format.\n-o &lt;name_of_BAM_output&gt;: This specifies the name of the output BAM file.\n&lt;name_of_BAM_input&gt;: This is the name of the input BAM file you want to filter.\n&lt;region&gt;: Specify the region you want to extract, such as chromosome3 or chromosome3:1-1000000 to limit the output to a specific range on chromosome 3.\n\nIn your case, the region is the name of the sequence of chromosome 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtools view -b -o chrom22.sorted.filter.bam chrom22.sorted.bam chromosome22\n\n\n\nThen index this file with samtools index as previously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nsamtools index chrom22.sorted.filter.bam\n\n\n\nDownload the two 2 bam files of the alignment of chromosome 22 (the .bam and the .bam.bai).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nscp &lt;login&gt;@tp.lbgi.fr:~/TdExome/mapping/chrom22.sorted.filter.bam* .\nNote: Replace &lt;login&gt; with your username. The tilde ~ is a shortcut for your home directory /home/&lt;username&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBAM files can be visualized using a browser. Display the filtered BAM data using IGV with Human hg38.\nYou can use your own files or used files available online. - Load the bam file chr22_filter.bam and chr22_filter.bai with Local (Tracks &gt; Local). - Load the bam file https://lbgi.fr/~merlat/TD3/chr22_filter.bam & the index file https://lbgi.fr/~merlat/TD3/chr22_filter.bai with URL (Tracks &gt; URL).\nZoom in to display a small region of chromosome 22 (or a gene such as APOL5). Configure the display to highlight mismatches.\nQ14. Are reads exclusively mapped on exonic regions? Why?\nQ15. Do you think that all observed mismatches correspond to variants?\nQ16. What criteria have to be fulfilled to infer variants?"
