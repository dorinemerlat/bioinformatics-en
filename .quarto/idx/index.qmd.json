They cover fundamental concepts and essential tools in bioinformatics with an introduction to the command line interface (CLI):\n\n- **[1 - Database exploration](tutorials-1A/tutorial1.qmd)**\n- **[2 - Functional analysis of a gene list and sequence comparison](tutorials-1A/tutorial2.qmd)**\n- **[3 - Similarity searches](tutorials-1A/tutorial3.qmd)**\n- **[4 - Analysis of protein families](tutorials-1A/tutorial4.qmd)**\n- **[5 - Multiple alignment and molecular phylogeny](tutorials-1A/tutorial5.qmd)**\n\n### 2A - Genomics and Epigenomics\nThe Genomics and Epigenomics tutorials are aimed at second-year students. They will guide you through several analyses commonly used in genomics:\n\n- **[1 - Pre-processing of sequencing reads](tutorials-2A/tutorial1.qmd)**\n- **[2 - Read mapping on a reference genome](tutorials-2A/tutorial2.qmd)**\n- **[3 - De novo assembly](tutorials-2A/tutorial3.qmd)**\n- **[4 - Annotation of a complete prokaryotic genome](tutorials-2A/tutorial4.qmd)**\n- **[5 - Analysis of eukaryotic sequences](tutorials-2A/tutorial5.qmd)**\n\n### 3A - Comparative and Medical Genomics\nThese advanced tutorials are intended for third-year students:\n\n- **[2 - Phylogenetic profiles and functional links](tutorials-3A/tutorial2.qmd)**\n- **[3 - Exome analysis](tutorials-3A/tutorial3.qmd)**\n- **[4 - Personal genomics: variants](tutorials-3A/tutorial4.qmd)**\n\n### Pharma - Introduction to Bioinformatics\nThese tutorials for fifth-year pharmacy students introduce some of the bioinformatics tools and techniques needed in pharmaceutical\n\n- **[1 - Pre-processing of sequencing reads](tutorials-pharma/tutorial1.qmd)**\n- **[2 - Database exploration](tutorials-pharma/tutorial2.qmd)**\n- **[3 - Functional analysis of a gene list and sequence comparison](tutorials-pharma/tutorial3.qmd)**\n- **[4 - Similarity searches](tutorials-pharma/tutorial4.qmd)**\n- **[5 - Multiple alignment](tutorials-pharma/tutorial5.qmd)**\n\n## Help and Support\n\nIf you need additional guidance, visit our **Help** section where you’ll find detailed resources to assist you with the technical aspects of the tutorials, as well as external links to bioinformatics courses:\n\n- **[Galaxy Help](help/galaxy-help.qmd)**: Get familiar with the Galaxy platform, a popular tool for conducting bioinformatics analyses without extensive programming knowledge.\n- **[CLI Help](help/cli-help.qmd)**: This guide will help you master the command-line tools essential for bioinformatics workflows.\n\nAdditionally, you will find links to other existing bioinformatics courses and external resources to enhance your learning experience.\n\n---\n\nWe hope these tutorials and resources will guide you in your bioinformatics journey, helping you develop the skills and knowledge needed for your academic and research projects.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nHere you will find all the materials needed for your bioinformatics practical sessions (TDs) at ESBS.\n\nIn addition to the exercise sheets, the site also provides useful resources such as guides and links to external courses that will help you become familiar with the tools and concepts you will need.\n\n\n## Practical sessions\n\n### 1A - Introduction to Bioinformatics\nHere are the tutorials for first-year students.
