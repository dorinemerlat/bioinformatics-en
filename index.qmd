# Welcome to the ESBS Bioinformatics Practical Sessions

Here you will find all the materials needed for your bioinformatics practical sessions (TDs) at ESBS.

In addition to the exercise sheets, the site also provides useful resources such as guides and links to external courses that will help you become familiar with the tools and concepts you will need.


## Available Courses and Tutorials

### 1A - Introduction to Bioinformatics (1st Year)
Here are the tutorials for first-year students. They cover fundamental concepts and essential tools in bioinformatics with an introduction to the command line interface (CLI):

- **[1 - Database exploration](tutorials-1A/tutorial1.qmd)**
